# Render VM Startup Script
#
# This script is intended to be used in an Ubuntu 18.04 cloud VM with an NVIDIA
# Tesla GPU. It is designed to run on startup, provision the VM if necessary,
# collect screenshots and create a PR on Github if there are any changes.
#
# NOTE: In order to use this script as a startup script in your own VM,
# uncomment the variables below and fill them in as appropriate, or else make
# sure the environment variables are set before this script is run.
##

# These values should definitely be customized:
# export GIT_USER_EMAIL=user@example.com
# export GIT_USER_NAME="User Name"
# export GITHUB_USER=example
# export GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN=your-github-access-token-here

# These values may not need to be customized:
export MODEL_VIEWER_REPOSITORY=https://$GITHUB_USER:$GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN@github.com/google/model-viewer.git
export MODEL_VIEWER_CHECKOUT_DIRECTORY=$HOME/model-viewer
export MODEL_VIEWER_BASE_BRANCH=master

##
# NOTE: No need to modify below this line when configuring for deployment
##

# Clone the repo if necessary
if [ ! -d ./model-viewer ]; then
  git clone $MODEL_VIEWER_REPOSITORY $MODEL_VIEWER_CHECKOUT_DIRECTORY
fi

pushd $MODEL_VIEWER_CHECKOUT_DIRECTORY

# Update <model-viewer> repo from the origin and reset the tracked branch
git fetch origin
git add .
git reset --hard origin/$MODEL_VIEWER_BASE_BRANCH
