# New location-based components

These are new location-based components, which aim to solve outstanding issues such as [#278](https://github.com/AR-js-org/AR.js/issues/278). 

The new components wrap the [three.js location-based AR.js API](https://github.com/AR-js-org/AR.js/tree/master/three.js/src/location-based) and are internally simpler and thus easier to maintain and debug. Thus, they are likely to see more active development and bug-fixes so it is recommended to try them first, and if they do not work for you, try [the original components](../location-based) instead.

Please see [the example](../../examples/new-location-based) to see how to use these components.
